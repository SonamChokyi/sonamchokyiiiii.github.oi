<p>Sky burial<sup>天葬</sup>
    is a funeral practice in which a human corpse is placed on a mountaintop to decompose while exposed to the elements or to be eaten by vultures. 
    It is a specific type of the general practice of excarnation.
     It is practiced in the region of Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia, as well as in Mongolia, Bhutan and parts of India. 
</p>Sky burials (or celestial burials, as they are also called) are the burial rites of choice for the Tibetans. After a member of the community has died, the body is cut into pieces by a Burial Master, and then taken to a selected site, usually in an area of high elevation. This is because the corpse is then supposed to be eaten by vultures, who tend to congregate at higher altitudes. <br />

 <h3>1.Preparation</h3>
 <p>After death, the body is wrapped carefully with a white traditional cloth. 
    The body is then laid in a cleaned corner in the house where the dead person used to live.
     The body is not to be disturbed as this might interrupt the souls’ transition into rebirth.
    The body remains in the house for at most five days after which it should be disposed off. 
    During this period, the family invites the monks or the Lamas who read the Holy Scriptures to the dead. It can expel the soul from the body and cleanses it from worldly sins.
<h3> Body disposal</h3>
<p>The final step of laying the soul to rest is feeding the body to the vultures. 
    The family of the dead, therefore, selects a day for the sky burial, calling it a ‘ lucky day.’
   The body is unwrapped and bent into a fetal position to symbolize rebirth into another world. The body carrier is then called upon to take the body to the burial site.
   The carrier deposits the body of the dead, usually, there are several in number, at the burial site and uses mulberry smoke to attract the starving vultures. 
   The Lamas offer prayers as the vultures devour the corpses.<br />

       </h2>
    
<p>At present, there are several big sky burial spots in Tibet. The Most famous sky burial place is Drigung  Monastery;  

    Among  sky burial places, Drigung Monastery's sky burial site is the tallest and largest one. In Tibetan, it means the place of eternal life.
     
    The founder of Drigung Monastery, Jigten Sumgon, announced to the world before he passed away "I have received Buddha's revelation to build a sky burial platform in Drigung Monastery. The corpses sent here can directly enter the celestial realm and get immortal...

    <a name="T4">Reasons for Sky burial</a>
    </h2>
<h3>Environment factors</h3>
<p>The average altitude of Tibet is above 4,000 meters, the year-round temperature is low, and two-thirds of the grasslands are in permafrost 1 meter below the surface, limiting the excavation.
    Burial ×
   </p>
<p>Limited forestry resources available due to the high cold, which restricts plant growth in most parts of Tibet.
    Cremation ×
<p>Large rivers in the highlands and for people to drink, and water burials pollute water sources.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>In the Ancient History of Xianxiong and Tibetan Tubo Dynasty, the vulture is called the "sacred bird" and no one can hurt it.
    The Bon religion believes that the vulture is a medium between human and heaven, bringing human souls to the invisible world of bliss.
   In this way, the vulture became the messenger of heaven and earth. With a place to give full play to its doctrine, the Bon religion also has a reasonable explanation for the sky burial, and more mysterious and religious, so the man-made sky burial began.
   </p>
<h3>Religion and culture</h3>
<p>When Buddhism was introduced to Tibet, it naturally clashed with the Bon religion. Tibetan Buddhism began to enter every aspect of people's life.
    Sky burial also evolved from a purely Bon religion domination to a funeral culture phenomenon with Tibetan Buddhist thought as the main content.
   </p>
<p>Therefore, people spare no effort to practice and pray for a good afterlife. 

    After death, Tibetans are very concerned about the destination of the soul, hoping that there is a shortcut to help the soul go to the heavenly realm, so the vulture in the sky burial becomes a prop to fulfill this wish.
    
    The ritual of sky burial has the worship of the sky, the taboo on the dead body, clothing and other legacy of the Bon religion, but also the "six reincarnations", karma(the spiritual principle of cause and effect) and other Tibetan Buddhist ideas, so more religious.

<h2>The values of Sky Burial </h2>
<img src="images-homework/4.png" width="200" height="142" />

<p>Tibetan Buddhists believe that the corpse is nothing but a discarded shell. The spirit of the deceased has already moved on, through death and toward a new incarnation. For Buddhists in Tibet , offering their bodies to vultures or birds is the last great and honorable thing to do. 

    With sky burial, there is no need to disturb the land to bury the body. This also expresses a value for environmental protection.
    
    sky burial is a kind of belief expressing people’s mourning of the deceased, which is essentially a social and cultural phenomenon influenced by the religion, natural geographical environment, mode of production and other factors.
